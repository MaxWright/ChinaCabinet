Description: This function will reverse the values in a string from head to 
             tail. The tail is what pointer is brought in. This function will
             manipulate the values of the string that is connected to the char
             that is brought in.

     Inputs: string - A pointer to the start of the reversing process.

    Outputs: N/A
